SKILL: The latest tweets from POTUS. With a little fun game attached to getting your tweets
SKILL explanation
You say 'Alexa ask the tweet Trumpet to give me some exciting tweets' and she will return the 5 latest tweets.
Now the game is that 'exciting' is not one of the President's favorite adjectives. If you can guess one of those
you earn points and these give you more tweets. so say your guess was the word 'boring' you could say:
'Alexa ask the tweet Trumpet to give me some boring tweets' and if boring was worth 3 points you would get 5+3 = 8 tweets.

You always get five tweets even if you miss.

The tweets are the latest tweets so it's hardly worth doing this more that once a day, but you might....

This app uses the standard tweet feed, and the tweets are modified to make them more understandable for Alexa,
but in not way is the content altered. That would be fake news!
